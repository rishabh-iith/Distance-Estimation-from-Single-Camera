Developed a model addressing the challenge of estimating distances to objects in real-world scenarios using live video feeds from a single camera. Tackled issues such as loss of depth information, complex scene structures, and dynamic environments.

Key Contributions:

Designed a real-time object detection system to identify objects in the scene.
Implemented distance estimation leveraging bounding box dimensions for accuracy.
Focused on applications like autonomous driving, enhancing collision avoidance and navigation safety.
This project bridges the gap between 2D image analysis and effective depth estimation, offering a scalable solution for real-world challenges.
