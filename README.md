# Distance-Estimation-from-Single-Camera
Developed a model to estimate object distances in real time using live video feeds from a single camera. Tackled challenges like depth loss and dynamic scenes. Implemented object detection and distance estimation using bounding box dimensions, with applications in autonomous driving and collision avoidance.
